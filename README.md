Despite its appeal and prominence in the sources, the route "from the Varangians to the Greeks" could never have functioned as the sole or main trade route, let alone as the foundation upon which Kyivan Rus' was formed. Attempts to artificially connect the accounts of Constantine Porphyrogenites with the text of the "Primary Chronicle" are usually based on dubious etymologies and outright misinterpretation of the primary source. This concept has become so deeply ingrained in the minds of scholars that even in the authoritative English translation of Porphyrogenites’ works by Jenkins, gross errors in interpretation have been made.Taken from military Shubert map, vectorized by Oleg Kasianov Kharkiv
